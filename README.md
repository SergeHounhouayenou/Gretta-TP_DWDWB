# First step 

1) Synchronizing my Intinerent Workspace

- I create a new repository for my project in the main branch of my GitHub or a specific one if I am sure and skilled enough to manage GitHub

- I install all the needed softwares in on my main computer. In this case we start with the Git, the programation and the virtualisation needs
	* Git ; Git GUI ; Git CMD ; Git Bash ; etc.
	* Visual Studio Code ; PHP STORM ; etc ; 
	* Node JS ; NVM ; NPM ; etc ; (clarify for thoses software  their différences and their specific rôles in the global work)
	* ESXi, Proxmox
	* Hyper-V, Workstation, VirtualBox
	* Docker Kubernetes

- I setup the relations between all applications (ex : Git and Docker in Visual Studio Code)
 
- I deploy the rest of the information system : Infrastructure; system and network ressources and job applications, for the physical and the Virtual devices (hyperviseur, serveurs, Active Directory, VMs, etc.)

- I setup the complementary software storage defined sollutions of the Information System by making sure that the Itinèrent Work is "Back up Safe"
